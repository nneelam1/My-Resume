        Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Neelam Nath, a dedicated M.Tech student in Computer Engineering with a profound love for both technology and arts.
        <br>
        By day, I delve into the complexities of coding and blogging, leveraging my technical skills to solve real-world problems. Outside the tech realm, I channel my creativity into traditional art forms and paintings. My passion for art has been a constant companion, providing a canvas for self-expression and a retreat from the digital domain. Exploring the rich tapestry of traditional art forms allows me to bridge the gap between the analytical and the artistic sides of my persona.
        
        Beyond the realms of technology and art, my curiosity leads me to explore the intricacies of social sciences.
        <br>
        I believe in the power of interdisciplinary knowledge and its ability to enrich our perspectives.
        
        I unleash my creativity as an artist, capturing moments through photography and experimenting with flavors in the kitchen.
        And did I mention I have a passion for singing? ðŸŽ¤ Being blessed with a good voice, I find immense joy in expressing myself through music. It's the perfect complement to my multifaceted interests.
        <br>
        Join me on this journey where technology meets artistic expression, and let's connect over a shared love for both code and canvas. ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»
